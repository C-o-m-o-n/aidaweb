# AIDA Web

This is the web interface for the AIDA project. It is a web application that allows users to interact with the AIDA system and engage in awesome conversations with the smart AIDA bot.

## Installation

AIDA is self-hosted by me and is available for public use at <https://aidaweb.jprq.app/>. However, if you want to host your own instance of AIDA, you can follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- A valid JPRQ account (for tunneling)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- All the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file
- Your own instance of the AIDA token backend (will explain later)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application by running `python app.py`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to access the AIDA web interface.
5. Enjoy!

## Usage

The AIDA web interface is very simple to use. You can interact with the AIDA bot by typing in the chat box and pressing the `Enter` key. The bot will respond to your messages in real-time. Everything else is pretty self-explanatory and intuitive, try to explore the interface yourself!

## Why is it only available to members of The Orange Squad?

This is originally developed for The Orange Squad, my Discord community. I have decided to keep it exclusive to members of The Orange Squad as it is a special feature for them. However, I am planning to make it available to the public in the future, perhaps with a public version of the AIDA bot.
